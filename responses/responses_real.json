There is a profound link between our Creator and the complexity of biodiversity, natural resources, and various environmental situations that surround us to provide and affect our human habitat. The beautify and mind-boggling organization of our natural world are clear indicators of a Creators’ hand in their design. Experiencing nature by being outdoors can help us connect to our Lord in a testament to this amazing and remarkable world of life and its surroundings:  for example the stunning dynamics of a sunset, the beautify of mountains and the seasonal color changes show its magnitude. However, many of us miss out on this experience due to fear, misunderstanding, or lack of opportunity. Surely, the absence of God in one's life is a significant loss. My experience has shown me that His guidance through life as realized in nature is real and transformative. My aim is to help others to meaningfully and viscerally experience the love and guidance of our Lord as I have. This is why my intent is to contribute to sustaining and protecting woodlands and natural resources in the state of SC. I have been blessed with resources that I am determined to nurture and share, not just in my lifetime but as a lasting legacy. By addressing and dispelling common misconceptions, I aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of nature and its link to God through this endeavor."
