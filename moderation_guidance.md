**Template for an individual INTENT**

I will restore my world to health,
By caring for my mental and physical well-being,
And using my outer and inner resources in my activities,
To cherish the planet and all who dwell here.

**Preparation for participant**

1. **Mindset**: Enter the session with an open mind and a focus on internal reflection.
Make sure that you will be undisturbed for the duration of the session, which will last
about two hours.
2. **Materials**: Have writing materials ready. Please use good size sticky notes and a
black pen, so that what you write can be read by yourself and others later. (You might
like to use a different colour sticky note for each question to distinguish them.

**Session Process (for Facilitator)**

1. **Introduction**: Briefly discuss the goal of the session – to define one's INTENT for
the planet, emphasizing personal well-being and care for the planet and it’s inhabitants.
Explain how this is a process to align our well-being with that of the planet. Read or
show the template INTENT to the participant, so they have an idea of what the end result
will be like.
2. Allow about 5 minutes per question – but this is not rigid. Give people time for their
thoughts to come out. You can give a one or two minute warning if you feel things are
going on for too long to keep within the time available. Focus on making the participant
feel relaxed and comfortable.

**Questions and Activities**

1. What is your world?**
- Reflect on what constitutes 'your world'. When you think of “your world” what comes
to mind? What is it that you can influence?
- Write down your thoughts, possibly on sticky notes. Just write down what comes to
mind.
2. What is "the planet" for you?**
- Contemplate your relationship and connection to the planet.
- Jot down your insights on the sticky notes. You can put more than one idea on each
note.
3. How do you care for your physical well-being?**
- Reflect on the things you do to support your physical well-being.
- Note these down. Just write down what comes to mind.
4. How do you care for your mental well-being?**
- Think about activities and practices that contribute to your mental health.


- Similar to the above. What are the things you do to give you mental peace? Write
these down.
5. What are your activities?**
- List your daily activities. What do you do?
- For the moment don’t be concerned about how these may or may not affect the
planet. Just simply – what are your activities. How do you spend your time?

AT THIS POINT, OR AFTER THE NEXT QUESTION, YOU CAN TAKE A BREAK OF 10
MINUTES OR SO.

6. What are your resources?**
- Write a list of your resources. These may be inner or outer resources. What do yo
have that you can use?

- You can also include things that you are planning to do soon.
9. What do I need to do more of?**
- Reflecting a little on what you have written above, what would you like to do more of?
10. What do I need to do less of?
- Reflecting on your life at the moment, what would benefit you to less of?

**Conclusion**

- **Creating Intent for the Planet**: Use the insights from the session to draft a statement
of intent for the planet, reflecting your personal values, goals, and the ways you wish to
contribute positively.
- Use the individual template “INTENT for the planet” as a kind of guide for you own
personal version.
- This is a creative process. Don’t think too hard about it. Just write down whatever
comes to mind.

**Post Session**

- Reflect on the session and the INTENT you've defined. Consider any adjustments or
additional thoughts that might arise post-session. You can keep re-writing your INTENT
based upon the thoughts you had during the session and continue to have.

**Optional**

- Sharing and discussing the outcomes with a facilitator or a trusted individual can
provide additional perspectives and insights.

**Notes**

- The process should be fluid and is adaptable to the individual's unique perspective,
needs and situation.


- The intent of the session is to encourage introspection and personal growth, leading to
a broader impact on the planet and its inhabitants.
- Documenting the session visually can be helpful for further reflection and action
planning.
